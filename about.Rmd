###Welcome to my Website!  
My name is Rosie Faddoul and I am a transfer student here at App. I am from Wilmington, North Carolina and graduated High School in 2015. After High School went to Cape Fear Community Collge for two years and then transfered to Appalachian State University.  I have a passion for social justice issues including the LGBTQ community, racial minorities, gender inequality, criminology, education and political systems and much more.  This is why I chose to get my Major in Sociology: Research Methods and minor in Statistics.  I chose the more analytical side of Sociology becuase I feel Sociology researchers are underrepresentated. 
I love Appalachian for the location as well as the sociology program.  I love the mountians and being able to hike or visit a waterfall or mountian top every and anyday.
